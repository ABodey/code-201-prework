### Install Atom Text Editor

Now it's time to install <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> and drag the app icon into your `/Applications` folder.

**TIP:** Remember to eject the disk image after installing the app.

Once installed, launch Atom using Spotlight Search.

### `atom` & `apm` (shell commands)

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into Atom from the Terminal.

Navigate to the following menu in Atom: `Atom->Install Shell Commands` (Select this option from the menu, and Atom will alert you when the commands have completed)

To verify Atom is wired up correctly, run the following command from your terminal.

```
atom
```
If Atom opens, you're good to go.

If Atom does not open, please notify an instructor or TA in your class Slack channel.
