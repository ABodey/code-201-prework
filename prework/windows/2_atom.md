### Install Atom Text Editor

Now it's time to install <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a>, a sophisticated text editor for code, markup, and prose.

To get started, download <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> and run the installer. Again, go with the default installation options, unless you really know you want to change something.

Once installed, use the Start Menu to launch Atom.

### `atom` & `apm` (shell commands)

You'll find it insanely useful to open files and directories into Atom from the Terminal.

To verify Atom is wired up correctly, run the following command from your Git-Bash terminal.

```
atom
```
If Atom opens, you're good to go.

If Atom does not open, please notify an instructor or TA in your class Slack channel.
