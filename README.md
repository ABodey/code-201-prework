Code 201: Foundations of Software Development
-----------------------

### Pre-work

There is mandatory pre-work for Code 201 that counts as 5% of your total course grade. That pre-work is outlined in six steps on this page. Note that in Step 3 there are specific instructions that are dependent upon your operating system, and also keep in mind that upon completing those steps that there are still Steps 4-6 to complete on this page, including code tutorials that take quite a bit of time.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Expect to spend, **at a minimum**, several evenings and a weekend day or two to get everything completed. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks and work at a methodical pace without rushing or trying to cut corners. Detailed time estimates are provided in the following overview.

##### NOTE: If you have taken Code 101 already, skip to #3. The guide in #3 is similar to Code 101's pre-work but contains additional steps you must complete prior to Code 201.

### Overview of Pre-work Steps *(time to complete per item)*

1. Code 101 *(optional, one full 12-hour day)* [Details](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-101/intro-to-software-development-and-careers-in-tech)
2. Laptop readiness *(time for this can vary widely depending upon the age and condition of your laptop)*
3. Setup Guide for Your OS *(multiple downloads are involved; 1-3 hours depending on your network speed)*
4. Download and Install Slack *(15-30 minutes)*
5. Purchase Required textbooks *(15-30 minutes)*
6. Tutorials on Codecademy
  - HTML/CSS *(Codecademy estimates 7 hours; we suggest allowing 10 hours)*
  - JavaScript *(Codecademy estimates 10 hours; we suggest allowing 20 hours because this is the most challenging piece of the pre-work)*

**Total estimated time for pre-work Steps 3-6: 18.5 to 34 hours of working time (not counting breaks)**

##### 1. Code 101 *(optional, one full 12-hour day)*
If you are completely new to coding, consider completing <a href="https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-101/intro-to-software-development-and-careers-in-tech" target="_blank">Code 101</a> to build your first website using HTML and CSS and to find out if a career in software development is right for you.

##### 2. Ensure your laptop up to the task of coding *(time for this can vary widely depending upon the age and condition of your laptop)*

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 3. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system *(multiple downloads are involved; 1-3 hours depending on your network speed)*

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"
 - Be able to open Atom from the Terminal or Git Bash.

##### 4. Download and Install Slack *(15-30 minutes)*

We use Slack to distribute files and collaborate before, during, and after the workshop.

Look for an email from us prior to the workshop, in order to join our Slack team.

Once you have joined, add a nice profile picture of your lovely face. Then say hello in your class channel, and introduce yourself.

##### 5. Purchase the required textbooks *(15-30 minutes)*

If you haven't already, purchase this textbook set prior to the first day of class:
