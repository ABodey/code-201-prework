Code 201: Foundations of Software Development
-----------------------

### Pre-work

##### NOTE: If you have taken Code 101 already, skip to #3. The guide in #3 is similar to Code 101's prework but contains additional steps you must complete prior to Code 201.

##### 1. Code 101
If you are completely new to coding, consider completing [Code 101](https://www.codefellows.org/courses/code-101/intro-to-software-development-and-careers-in-tech) to build your first website using HTML and CSS and to find out if a career in software development is right for you.

##### 2. Ensure your laptop up to the task of coding

  - Is virus and malware free
  - Uses the latest, stable, updated version of its operating system
  - Has a functioning screen, keyboard, and trackpad
  - Has plenty of free hard drive space and memory
  - Can reliably connect to wireless networks

##### 3. Complete the setup guide for your computer's operating system

  - [Mac OS X](prework/mac/1_terminal.md)
  - [Ubuntu](prework/ubuntu/1_terminal.md)
  - [Windows](prework/windows/1_terminal.md)

Following completion of these Pre-work assignments, you should:
 - Have a terminal with a Git compatible prompt
 - Be able to receive a valid response when typing "git --version"
 - Be able to open Sublime Text from the Terminal or Git Bash.

##### 4. Download and Install Slack

We use Slack to distribute files and collaborate before, during, and after the workshop.
